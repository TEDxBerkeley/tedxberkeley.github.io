Arrive early We encourage you to arrive at 9AM, an hour before the first speaker sessions begin. Arriving early means you’ll be able to network with other incredible thinkers and doers. Stay until the very end. We recommend you plan to stay through the
farewell party – until at least 7PM. TEDxBerkeley is an unusual conference in that our attendees stay for its entirety — every session and special event, right up through the Farewell Party. Clear your calendar. No, really. To help you get the most out
of TEDxBerkeley, we ask that you lend us your brain. Ignore your email. Switch off your phone. Don’t take meetings. TED is an immersive experience, and you won’t want to miss a moment. Talk to strangers. TEDxBerkeley is teeming with amazing people. Most
speakers stay all day long, and the attendees, in truth, are every bit as extraordinary. As a result, chance encounters at TEDxBerkeley often lead to new ideas, projects, perspectives, companies … They’re as essential to the experience as the program
itself. Don’t miss a thing. Watch every session. Go to every event. The best TED moments happen when you least expect them. It’s invariably the unknown speakers who wow the crowd. Watching every session helps you avoid disappointment, and ensures you
take in each key moment as it happens. Social events, too, are there for a reason. Leave your laptop at home. And your cell phone in your bag. The speakers at TEDxBerkeley merit your full attention, and laptops and cell phones are a big distraction –
not just for you, but for everyone around you. To preserve an immersive experience, we don’t allow cell phone use in the theater. Blogging is permitted from the back row and the balcony, and is welcomed in the social spaces. Let us help you. Our staff
will do their best to answer any questions and solve any problems, from logistics queries to laptop breakdowns. Pre-conference, contact us via email at info@tedxberkeley.org. On-site, visit our concierge at the registration desk, or ask anyone wearing
a Staff badge. Share your experience with others. If you plan to blog, take photos, or Twitter, use these tags: #TEDxBerkeley, #TEDx. Take pictures, share your TEDxBerkeley memories with friends and family during and after the event.
