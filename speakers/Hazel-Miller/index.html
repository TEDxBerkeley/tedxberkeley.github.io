            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Hazel Miller is not just a great singer; "She is a force of nature!" quotes the Rocky Mountain News. Her voice has been called "stunning, moving and powerful." Hazel has been a sought after performer in Colorado for the past 3 decades.  Ms. Miller has performed for al the Denver major league sports teams.  HMB has performed for 6 sitting governors and mayors and 4 US presidents.  The current Hazel Miller Band has been performing for 3 years all over Colorado and nationally.

HMB's music is designed to excite and involve the audience.  The band's music choices are familiar and unique.<br/><br/>2017 is off to a great start...HMB played for a most interesting group of diverse movers and shakers in the USA and the world in Vail. Summer of 2017 brought me the honor of singing back up vocals for Garth Brooks, Amy Grant and John Oates.  The occasion was the 2017 Colorado Music Hall of Fame induction Ceremony.  HMB is booked for The Telluride Jazz Fest, Tri Lakes Arts Center, Sounds of the Summer music series, Prospect Sound Bites music series, The Beaver Creek music series, Bravo Vail Gala, just to name a few of the high profile festivals we'll be playing this summer.

We just added Boettcher Concert Hall to the venues we've played.  It was so glorious to be on that stage opening for Big Head Todd Blues Club.  Hazel Miller sang the national anthem on Monday Night Football, for the World Champion Denver Broncos, October 24, 2016.  It was a nationally televised game with 30 million people watching.<br/><br/>The highlight of 2015 were Ms. Miller’s singing of the national anthem at the inauguration of Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, January, 13, 2015.
