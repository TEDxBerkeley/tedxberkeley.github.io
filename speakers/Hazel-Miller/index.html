            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Hazel Miller is not just a great singer; "She is a force of nature!" quotes the Rocky Mountain News. Her voice has been called "stunning, moving and powerful." Hazel has been a sought after performer in Colorado for the past 3 decades.  Ms. Miller has performed for al the Denver major league sports teams.  HMB has performed for 6 sitting governors and mayors and 4 US presidents.  The current Hazel Miller Band has been performing for 3 years all over Colorado and nationally.  Ms. Miller and her band has just been voted "Best R&B" Band for 2017 in the Westword magazine.<br/>HMB performs an eclectic blend of Jazz, R&B, Blues, Gospel and original music.   HMB's music is designed to excite and involve the audience.  The band's music choices are familiar and unique.<br/><br/>2017 is off to a great start...HMB played for a most interesting group of diverse movers and shakers in the USA and the world in Vail. Summer of 2017 brought me the honor of singing back up vocals for Garth Brooks, Amy Grant and John Oates.  The occasion was the 2017 Colorado Music Hall of Fame induction Ceremony.  HMB is booked for The Telluride Jazz Fest, Tri Lakes Arts Center, Sounds of the Summer music series, Prospect Sound Bites music series, The Beaver Creek music series, Bravo Vail Gala, just to name a few of the high profile festivals we'll be playing this summer.  WestWord Magazine named HMB the "Best R&B Band 2017".<br/><br/>The highlights of 2016: Ms. Miller performed at Red Rocks Amphitheater for the 30th Anniversary Celebration for Big Head Todd & the Monsters.  Ms. Miller returned to Red Rocks, two days later, to sing the National Anthem for the 75th Anniversary of Red Rocks.  The 2016 summer will feature the Hazel Miller Band in Edwards, Salida, Castle Rock, Leadville (Tabor Opera House), Lafayette, Longmont, Durango (Durango Blues Train), Greeley (Greeley Blues Jam) and Winter Park (Winter Park Jazz Festival), the 125th Anniversary of the Historic Elitch Theatre is an especially sentimental event for the band.  We just added Boettcher Concert Hall to the venues we've played.  It was so glorious to be on that stage opening for Big Head Todd Blues Club.  Hazel Miller sang the national anthem on Monday Night Football, for the World Champion Denver Broncos, October 24, 2016.  It was a nationally televised game with 30 million people watching.<br/><br/>The highlight of 2015 were Ms. Miller’s singing of the national anthem at the inauguration of Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, January, 13, 2015.  Later on that night the Governor’s Inaugural Concert featured the Lumineers, String Cheese Incident and Big Head Todd and the Monsters with Ms. Miller.  Ms. Miller performed at the FIS Alpine Ski Championships in Beaver Creek, Colorado on February 15,2015; with an estimated international television audience of 180,000,000 viewers worldwide.

They toured the entire country with great response from audiences. Ms. Miller had a great summer, 2014, of festival appearances in Grand Junction, Del Norte, Pagosa Springs, Frisco, Breckenridge, Erie, Boulder, Telluride, Mississippi, New Mexico and Wyoming.  HMB has appeared many times at the historic Red Rocks Amphitheater as the head liner and as an opener.
