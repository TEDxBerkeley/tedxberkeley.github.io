        <p class="profile-copy">Bio:<br/><br/>Music and storytelling have always been a vital part of CharlesÍ life growing up in the South. However, despite thorough tutelage from his staunchly religious grandmother, who insisted upon him learning church hymns as a child, Charles
          never aspired to walk the path of a performing artist. He dreamed of playing professional football. After a disappointing end to his athletic career, he then pursued a career in Corporate America with IBM. After two successful years as a sales
          representative, he left to spearhead a regional office of another large company. A year from the date he started, he was fired. It wasnÍt until a friend encouraged his potential as a singer and actor that CharlesÍ love for music resurfaced.<br/><br/>In
          July1996, Charles, led by intuition, left the comforts of the South with $400 dollars for the bright lights of Broadway. He has since starred in some of the most celebrated and spectacular productions in American theatre history including Smokey
          JoeÍs Caf_, Jesus Christ Superstar, and Lion King. He was the first African American to play the role of ïRockyÍ in the European tour of The Rocky Horror Show. Charles adds guest starring roles in Law & Order: Criminal Intent, All My Children,
          the award winning independent film Anne B. Real, and the thought provoking comedy, EdÍs Trip. He received national acclaim and rave reviews for his 20-character portrayal in his one-man stage play Black Boy, based on best selling author Richard
          WrightÍs autobiographical landmark, as well as his portrayal of Civil Rights activist and icon, W.E.B. Du Bois in the one-man production, The Smoke King. Charles recently toured the country in Never Fight a Shark in Water, a one-man play based
          on the life of Gregory Bright who was exonerated after spending 27 _ years in LouisianaÍs Angola Penitentiary for wrongful conviction of second-degree murder.<br/><br/>Charles with fellow actor Gerald C. Rivers will present and tour the world
          premiere event Martin & Music in January 2012. The play chronicles the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., while threading KingÍs love for music into his speeches and life experience.<br/><br/>Charles has entertained sold-out audiences around
          the world, including The John F. Kennedy Center The Turkish-American Association in Ankara, Turkey, and Rikers Island Correctional Facility. He speaks to groups and organizations and serves as facilitator of workshops based on his work as an

        <p class="profile-copy">Nipun Mehta is the founder of ServiceSpace (formerly ServiceSpace), an incubator of projects that works at the intersection of volunteerism, technology and gift-economy. What started as an experiment with four friends in the Silicon Valley has
          now grown to an global ecosystem of over 350,000 members that has delivered millions of dollars in service for free. Nipun has received many awards, including the Jefferson Award for Public Service, the PresidentÍs Volunteer Service Award and
          Wavy GravyÍs Humanitarian award. He is routinely invited to share his message of ñgiftivismî to wide ranging audiences, from inner city youth in Memphis to academics in London to international dignitaries at the United Nations. He serves on
          the advisory boards of the Seva Foundation, the Dalai Lama Foundation, and Greater Good Science Center.<br/><br/>NipunÍs high-school goal was to either become a tennis-pro or a Himalayan Yogi. Instead, by the third year of his Computer Science
          and Philosophy degree at UC Berkeley, he started his software career at Sun Microsystems. Dissatisfied by the dot-com greed of the late 90s, Nipun went to a homeless shelter with three friends to ñgive with absolutely no strings attached.î They
          ended up creating a website, and also an organization titled ServiceSpace. Over the years, they built thousands of websites for nonprofits but also started incubating a diverse set of projects that included online portals DailyGood and KarmaTube,
          offline movements like Smile Cards, a pay-it-forward rickshaw in India, and Karma Kitchen restaurants in three cities across the US. In 2001, at the age of 25, Nipun quit his job to become a ñfull time volunteer.î He didnÍt have a plan of survival
          beyond six months, but so far, so good.<br/><br/>In January 2005, Nipun and Guri, his wife of six months, put everything aside to embark on an open-ended, unscripted walking pilgrimage in India, to ñuse our hands to do random acts of kindness,
          our heads to profile inspiring people, and our hearts to cultivate truth.î Living on a dollar a day, eating wherever food was offered, sleeping wherever a flat surface was found, the couple walked 1000 kilometers before ending up at a retreat
          center, where they meditated for three months. Today, both Nipun and Guri live in Berkeley and stay rooted in a practice of small acts of service. The journey continues.<br/><br/>NipunÍs mission statement in life now reads: ñBring smiles in
          the world and stillness in my heart.î</p>
