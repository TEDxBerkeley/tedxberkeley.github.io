        <p class="profile-byline">Singer and Songwriter</p>
        <p class="profile-copy">On the surface, Sonia Rao is a pop singer/songwriter with over 35 film and television placements and a BMI Spotlight Artist. Her songs have been featured on MTV’s Jersey Shore, ABC’s The Vineyard, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, and many others.
          But dig into Sonia’s music and you’ll discover she’s an vessel of inspiration. At a recent TEDxWomen event, she was asked to perform and speak about gender equality, just one of the issues she holds dear. Sonia captivated the room with her energy,
          and it’s with that same spirit that she welcomes us into her world on her forthcoming album, Meet Them At The Door, her most transparent work yet.</p>

        <p class="profile-byline">UC Berkeley Celli Performance Group</p>
        <p class="profile-copy">Celli@Berkeley was created one night in 2012 after the cellists of the UC Berkeley Symphony Orchestra realized that the only thing better than one cello was many, many cellos. Composed of sixteen students studying a variety of academic disciplines,
          they are united by a desire to express the possibilities of the cello. They love performing and sharing music ranging from classical to pop, not only in concert halls but also outdoors - by the Campanile, in art galleries, at marathons or flea
          markets, and on the streets of Berkeley!</p>
