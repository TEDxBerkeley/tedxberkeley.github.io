        <p class="profile-byline">UC Berkeley Celli Performance Group</p>
        <p class="profile-copy">Celli@Berkeley was created one night in 2012 after the cellists of the UC Berkeley Symphony Orchestra realized that the only thing better than one cello was many, many cellos. Composed of sixteen students studying a variety of academic disciplines,
          they are united by a desire to express the possibilities of the cello. They love performing and sharing music ranging from classical to pop, not only in concert halls but also outdoors - by the Campanile, in art galleries, at marathons or flea
          markets, and on the streets of Berkeley!</p>
