        <h2 class="profile-name">François Reyes</h2>
        <p class="profile-byline">President & Founder of Réveil Citoyen</p>
        <p class="profile-copy">Born in 1996 in the North of France, François Reyes has since his earliest years developed an interest in politics. But these past few years, after working for a senator during some time in France, he realized that change could only come from
          civil society. Deeply impacted by the lack of interest of the politicians in his homecountry for making people's lives better and countering extremism, he grew the desire to work as hard as possible with 'everyday people' in order to counter
          the lack of interest of the politicians. After the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks in January 2015 in Paris, he created a global NGO called Citizen's Awakening, that has for a goal to counter extremism and create understanding through bringing
          together people, through dialogue. Citizen's Awakening now is present in Canada, the UK, India, Hungary, France, and many other countries. Impacted on a personnal level by the Paris attacks of November 2015, he pledged to fight as hard as he
          could againt terrorism worldwide with what he believes is the most powerful weapon on the long term to tackle extremism : our ability so speak up, and to create bridges between different communities and different countries. François Reyes is
          also a speaker and an ambassador for One Young World & the Quilliam Foundation, and a member of the FATE (Families Against Terrorism & Extremism) network. He's in the middle of writing a book gathering the voices and solutions of/from/for families
          impacted one way or the other by terrorism, whether they lost a member of their family in a terrorist attack, or a child to the extremist-narrative. </p>

        <p class="profile-copy">There’s something very special about Damien. Actually, “special” may not be the best word. In times like these, in the world that we live in, there’s something relevant, significant and necessary about Damien – and people like him. You can go
          to pretty much any search engine, put “Damien Horne” in the search field and read about his life story and credentials. The cliff notes is he’s from Hickory, North Carolina. He’s one of twelve children (a blended family). He’s a middle child,
          adores his mother, is the first in his family to earn a high school diploma and now devotes a lot of his time and resources trying to make a better life for his loved ones and those around him. Although they didn’t grow up with a lot of monetary
          wealth (barely any to speak of), Damien’s mother had a love for God that inspired him to develop a personal relationship with Christ at the age of 7. It’s there where his hope journey began… The loss of brothers, experiencing family members

          answer might surprise you. After receiving his associate’s degree from Free Will Baptist Bible College and becoming an ordained minister, Damien is intentional about giving back. Giving back by sharing his testimony. Giving back by serving at
          his home church, The Salvation Army. Giving back by offering words of encouragement, support and faith – anywhere he can. Damien recently started a blog that centers around his mission to surround others with hope. It’s called encourageinspiremotivate.com.
          Each week, there are new videos and articles on platforms he’s committed to: homelessness, human trafficking, prison ministry, world outreach, youth, adoption and the Word. That said, it should come as no surprise that Dr. Martin Luther King,
          Jr., Gandhi and Mother Teresa are some of his “purpose mentors” and life heroes. “Music is a talent God’s given me,” shares Damien. “It’s a tool that has opened up so many doors that I’m thankful for. But my heart is to speak to and reach out
          to as many“Music is a talent God’s given me,” shares Damien. “It’s a tool that has opened up so many doors that I’m thankful for. But my heart is to speak to and reach out to best“Music is a talent God’s givntact with.” Yep. Anyone who thinks
          like that is relevant, significant – and very necessary. Indeed. For such a time as this. </p>
