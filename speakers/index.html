          Loma Linda University. She is a published author on the relationship between education and maternal weight gain in U.S. Mothers. Alongside her studies, she volunteered at a nonprofit that served the youth experiencing homelessness. For two years,
          she digitized their data collection process and spent time with the youth providing public health services. This experience led her to devout her master’s thesis to researching better ways to help them with respect to their mental health and
          utilization of more public health services. Chandni now brings her unique interdisciplinary background into the workplace. She serves as a Product Manager at Great Place To Work Inc, a global organization that creates great workplaces for all.

        <h2 class="profile-name">Khalid Kadir</h2>
        <p class="profile-byline">Professor at UC Berkeley</p>
        <p class="profile-copy">Khalid is a Continuing Lecturer at UC Berkeley, teaching courses in the Global Poverty & Practice (GPP) program, Political Economy, and the College of Engineering. He received his PhD in 2010 from Berkeley in Civil and Environmental Engineering,
          where his research focused on pathogen removal in natural water and wastewater treatment systems. While completing this research, Khalid was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship to work on water and wastewater treatment systems in Morocco. During
          this time, he began studying the complex role that engineering expertise plays in the politics of international development and poverty alleviation. His current research focuses on the politics of technology, engineering education, and the design
          of water and sanitation systems for humanitarian contexts. In 2013 Khalid was selected as a Chancellor’s Public Scholar to create and teach an innovative interdisciplinary engineering course that combines community-engaged scholarship with classroom
          learning to train future engineers to engage with the social and political roots of their technical work. In recognition of his work on this unique course and of his teaching in the GPP program, Khalid was awarded the 2014 Chancellor’s Award
          for Public Service for Service-Learning Leadership. More recently, in 2017 Khalid received UC Berkeley’s Distinguished Teaching Award, the campus’ most prestigious honor for teaching.</p>
