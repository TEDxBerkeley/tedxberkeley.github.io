        <p class="profile-byline">President & Founder of Réveil Citoyen</p>
        <p class="profile-copy">Born in 1996 in the North of France, François Reyes has since his earliest years developed an interest in politics. But these past few years, after working for a senator during some time in France, he realized that change could only come from
          civil society. Deeply impacted by the lack of interest of the politicians in his homecountry for making people's lives better and countering extremism, he grew the desire to work as hard as possible with 'everyday people' in order to counter
          the lack of interest of the politicians. After the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks in January 2015 in Paris, he created a global NGO called Citizen's Awakening, that has for a goal to counter extremism and create understanding through bringing
          together people, through dialogue. Citizen's Awakening now is present in Canada, the UK, India, Hungary, France, and many other countries. Impacted on a personnal level by the Paris attacks of November 2015, he pledged to fight as hard as he
          could againt terrorism worldwide with what he believes is the most powerful weapon on the long term to tackle extremism : our ability so speak up, and to create bridges between different communities and different countries. François Reyes is
          also a speaker and an ambassador for One Young World & the Quilliam Foundation, and a member of the FATE (Families Against Terrorism & Extremism) network. He's in the middle of writing a book gathering the voices and solutions of/from/for families
          impacted one way or the other by terrorism, whether they lost a member of their family in a terrorist attack, or a child to the extremist-narrative. </p>

        <h2 class="profile-name">Damien Horne</h2>
        <p class="profile-byline">National Recording Artist</p>
        <p class="profile-copy">Damien Horne Speaking Bio <br/><br/>There’s something very special about Damien. Actually, "special" may not be the best word. In times like these, in the world that we live in, there’s something relevant, significant and necessary about Damien
          – and people like him. You can go to pretty much any search engine, put "Damien Horne" in the search field and read about his life story and credentials. The cliff notes is he’s from Hickory, North Carolina. He’s one of twelve children (a blended
          family). He’s a middle child, adores his mother, is the first in his family to earn a high school diploma and now devotes a lot of his time and resources trying to make a better life for his loved ones and those around him. Although they didn’t
          grow up with a lot of monetary wealth (barely any to speak of), Damien’s mother had a love for God that inspired him to develop a personal relationship with Christ at the age of 7. <br/><br/>It’s there where his hope journey began…<br/><br/>The
          loss of brothers, experiencing family members being incarcerated and figuring out how to make ends meet led Damien to want more for himself. As a young adult, he first moved to LA. After being homeless a couple of years, he returned back to
          North Carolina and saved enough money to move to Nashville. Damien found himself homeless again. Only this time, a country star by the name of John Rich (of Big & Rich) put a nice chunk of change in his guitar case – and extended an invitation…to
          basically a whole new life.<br/><br/>As a musician.<br/>As a public speaker.<br/>As a world changer.<br/><br/>From Faith Hill and Keith Urban to Robert Randolph and John Legend, Damien has either opened up for or performed alongside these award-winning
          artists. He’s also been part of a country trio The Farm. He’s also had a publishing deal with Warner Chapel and released several solo projects including his latest EP The Love Saga Vol. 1. Yes, he has a few bragging rights.<br/><br/>But if you
          were to ask Damien what he’s most passionate about, his answer might surprise you. After receiving his associate’s degree from Free Will Baptist Bible College and becoming an ordained minister, Damien is intentional about giving back.<br/><br/>Giving
          back by sharing his testimony.<br/><br/>Giving back by serving at his home church, The Salvation Army.<br/><br/>Giving back by offering words of encouragement, support and faith – anywhere he can.<br/><br/>Damien recently started a blog that
          centers around his mission to surround others with hope. It’s called encourageinspiremotivate.com. Each week, there are new videos and articles on platforms he’s committed to: homelessness, human trafficking, prison ministry, world outreach,
          youth, adoption and the Word. That said, it should come as no surprise that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Gandhi and Mother Teresa are some of his "purpose mentors" and life heroes.<br/><br/>"Music is a talent God’s given me," shares Damien.
          "It’s a tool that has opened up so many doors that I’m thankful for. But my heart is to speak to and reach out to as many people as I can. I want to let them know that their purpose and dreams are possible. Every day, I wake up with that on
          my mind. Every night, I fall asleep hoping that I did my best to inspire those I came into contact with."<br/><br/>Yep. Anyone who thinks like that is relevant, significant – and very necessary. <br/><br/>Indeed. For such a time as this. <br/></p>

          of Uranus, Jupiter and Mars to applications in climate change and energy optimization until one day her child suddenly took ill and she confronted her greatest challenge; to solve a serious health mystery.<br/><br/>Follow her as she takes her
          intuition on an emotional journey to save her child where a constellation of scientific perspectives transmutes fear into love to spark hope through a fog of determination. When we see the world of any problem again through the fresh eyes of
          a child free from the conventional lenses of entrenched expertise, there is a simple awakening that can illuminate the big ah-ha of a great hypothesis.<br/><br/>Loretta shares a deep commitment to science, education and advancing the quality
          of human spirit. While waiting for code to compile she enjoys classical ballet, puppies and alpine walks in Lake Como, Italy where she lives with her husband and three children.</p>

        <p class="profile-copy"><i>"This will be our reply to violence: to make music more intensely, more beautifully, more devotedly than ever before." - Leonard Bernstein</i><br/><br/>In the summer of 2012, Darin Chhing, the son of Cambodian refugees, began composing a piece
          blending both Eastern and Western melodies with his culture’s rich musical heritage. <br/><br/>Nearly five years later, the TEDxBerkeley Orchestra is pleased to premiere excerpts from Darin’s original composition entitled Singularity, dedicated
          to those impacted by recent terror attacks, the ongoing Syrian refugee crisis, and the pressing social and political challenges that constitute adversity in our dynamic global society.<br/><br/>As Darin recalls, "The stories in the news of people
          fleeing their war-torn country are, in many ways, the stories of my aunts, uncles, and parents escaping genocide and resettling in the United States. This piece is a call for hope, solidarity, and love in the face of fear, anger, and cynicism."
          <br/><br/>At the heart of the TEDxBO lies both the generous commitment and dedication of its exceptionally talented and diverse family of college student musicians, all from across the Berkeley community, as well as a devotion to fostering a
          space where curiosity, imagination, innovation, and collective storytelling all thrive in concert. <br/><br/>Through the sheer power and deep beauty of film scores, Darin aspires to continue sharing music’s inherent ability to express the soul
          and strengthen the bonds that unite communities across oceans and borders.<br/><br/>On April 15, we hope you will join us and become part of our musical constellation.<br/></p>
