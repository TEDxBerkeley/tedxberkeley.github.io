        <p class="profile-byline">Singer, Songwriter, Visionary</p>
        <p class="profile-copy">Daughter of a blues & jazz guitarist and an avid music fan, the lullabies of YonatÍs infancy were Albert Collins and Coltrane. The metallic smell of her dadÍs fender guitar amp stayed with Yonat into early childhood, when she would sing Love Potion
          No 9 to a rapt crowd with his band in the bars of Tel Aviv and Milwaukee. Grade school saw her singing lead parts in her Jewish school choir and performing in professional theatre companies around Milwaukee. Soon Yonat woke to Aretha Franklin,
          Carole King & Sheryl Crow. She spent her teenage years listening to Lauryn Hill and Dinah Washington on repeat, mimicking their every inflection.<br/><br/>After being rejected from the Israeli army band auditions she enlisted and served a tiresome
          2 years as a soldier during the revival of Israeli spiritual folk music and found a close role model in IsraelÍs leading folk singer, David Broza, who kept rooting for her to follow her dreams. Back in civilian clothes, she enrolled at Rimon,
          IsraelÍs leading contemporary music school where she was turned off by the humdrum of music theory and Israeli pop culture songwriting. She soon fled to India to deepen studies in Indian spirituality and Hindustani Classical Vocal music, as
          well as a long, sordid love affair that helped her hone her skill in writing heartbreak songs.<br/><br/>Yonat returned to the US in 2008 and moved to San Francisco to pursue a masters degree in psychotherapy. At the time of graduation her fatherÍs
          health deteriorated and she took this turn of events as the driving force behind putting her psychology career on hold in pursuit of her number one passion _ music.<br/>Performing around the Bay Area since 2011 with her band Yonat & Her Muse
          _ a folk-soul ensemble reminiscent of Norah Jones meets Adele _ the band has shared the stage with artists such as post rock musician Fink and singer-songwriter Foy Vance.<br/><br/>Holding YonatÍs songs together at the core is always an intrinsic
          message of self-experience, reflection, and empowerment. Her self-released EP Daybreak produced by Jordan Feinstein and Robin Applewood dropped in August 2013.</p>

        <p class="profile-copy">Seeking out the desert tortoises which have charmed him for three decades, desert biologist Tim Shields has walked a number of miles equivalent to circumnavigating the Earth. Over thousands of daysÍ careful observation he has helped unlock secrets
          of tortoise biology which will lead directly to the preservation of this bellwether species. Shields is an integral member of the scientific team that documented the tortoiseÍs decline and whose work led to its listing as a threatened species.<br/><br/>Frustrated
          by the mental roadblocks humans set for themselves, and looking for efficacious new means to help desert species thrive, Tim has stepped outside ordinary thought patterns about conservation. He is now engaging the brightest minds available in
          engineering, education, business, Earth systems and games. His company, Hardshell Labs, is developing novel combinations of emergent technologies to provide solutions to a simple but critical problem: how to make conservation not only meaningful
          but fun, thus attracting many more active participants.<br/><br/>Tim co-founded and for seven years was executive director of Takshanuk Watershed Council, a very successful watershed conservation and public education non-profit. He is also an
          accomplished wildlife artist, drama coach and morning host of a public radio show in his home town, Haines, Alaska. His artwork has appeared in numerous publications and prestigious traveling exhibitions. His perspectives on conservation biology
          have been quoted by CNN, the Los Angeles Times Magazine and the Sierra Club. A chapter in a forthcoming book on desert conservation to be published by Death Valley National Park will present his prescriptions for ensuring the survival of the
          desert tortoise. He has also authored, co-authored and illustrated numerous scientific papers.</p>
