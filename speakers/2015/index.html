        <h2 class="profile-name">Carolyn Gable</h2>
        <p class="profile-byline">CEO and Founder of Expect a Miracle!</p>
        <p class="profile-copy">As the Founder & CEO of a multi-million dollar 3rd party logistics firm, CarolynÍs road to a successful businesswoman was hardly typical. An average high school student with little motivation and no money to go to college, Carolyn graduated from
          beauty school to realize she had little interest in the trade. In order to make ends meet, she began waiting tables, a job she held for over a decade. Working in an exclusive restaurant atop of the Hyatt Chicago, wearing the mandatory uniform
          designed to appeal to the male clientele (including four-inch high heels), she waited on business men & women from all over the country. As a single mother, working for tips and living hand-to-mouth, it was barely enough to cover rent and feed
          her two kids. Something had to change. The change arrived one day when the roof of the restaurant was damaged in a storm, forcing Carolyn to find work quickly. She walked into an employment office and said she wanted a sales job. The counsellor
          looked at Carolyn, at her previous work experience, and said the best he could do was a Customer Service position at a freight company. Entering the male-dominated freight industry, Carolyn dedicated herself to learning the business and soon
          found herself in the sales position. A few years later, as the industry became de-regulated, Carolyn recognized an opportunity and started her own business, New Age Transportation, Distribution & Warehousing, Inc. As her business flourished,
          Carolyn never forgot the struggles she endured as a single mother trying to make ends meet as a waitress. With a desire to help ease the financial burdens single, working parents encounter, she created the Expect A Miracle Foundation. The non-profit
          organization provides assistance for childrenÍs extra-curricular activities _ an expense many single parents struggle to afford. Since 2001, the organization has helped nearly 6000 children! The dynamic author of Everything I Know as a CEO I
          Learned as a Waitress, Carolyn outlines her principles for success _ which can be applied within business and in oneÍs personal life. Sharing her life experiences and inspirational thoughts, the confidence her writing instills in the reader
          to take their own journey is undeniable. Her latest book, The Miracle Path, captures the hope, strength, and courage of others as they continue on their lifeÍs journey. A must-read for anyone that needs a little encouragement in pursuit of a
          miracle! Carolyn generates the spark that you need to believe in yourself and to achieve your goals. She is living proof that individuals can overcome obstacles, beat the odds, and succeed. Hearing her tell her story, her words of inspiration,
          and her positive approach to the most difficult situations is as insightful to the CEO as it is to the single parent.</p>

        <p class="profile-copy">Dan Garcia is a Senior Lecturer with Security Of Employment in the EECS Department at the University of California, Berkeley, and joined the faculty in the fall of 2000. Dan received his PhD and MS in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 2000
          and 1995, and dual BS degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering from MIT in 1990. He was chosen as an ACM Distinguished Educator in 2012. He is active participant in SIGCSE (the annual computer science education conference, having
          presented every year since 2001), and is currently working with the ICSI Teaching Privacy research project. He serves on the ACM Education Board, the Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles Development Committee, is the faculty champion
          for the local Computer Science Teachers Association chapter, and the faculty co-director for BFOIT, a wonderful Berkeley K-12 outreach effort. He is the only person to have won all four of the departmentÍs teaching awards: * the Information
          Technology Faculty Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in 2004 * the Diane S. McEntyre Award for Excellence in Teaching in 2002, * the EECS outstanding graduate student instructor award in 1998, and * the CS outstanding graduate student
          instructor award in 1992. He was also chosen as a UC Berkeley ñUnsung Heroî in 2005. He holds the record for the highest teaching effectiveness ratings (6.7/7) in the history of the departmentÍs lower-division introductory courses. He recently
          co-developed a computing course for non-majors, ñCS10: The Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC)î. This redesign earned a ñBears Breaking Boundariesî curriculum design award, a Lockheed Martin broadening participation grant, and was twice chosen
          as a national pilot for the new Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles course. In the Spring of 2013, the course had more women than men in it, marking the first time (in campus recorded history) an introductory computing course at UC
          Berkeley achieved that distinction. Thanks to four NSF grants, they have already offered professional development to 200 high school teachers across the country, and starting in the summer of 2015, will begin working with 100 more teachers in
          New York City (his hometown), the largest school district in the country. He is developing a free edX MOOC course based on BJC, to reach even more teachers and students, launching on Labor Day, 2015.</p>

        <h2 class="profile-name">Eric Holt-Gim©nez</h2>
        <p class="profile-byline">Executive Director of Food First </p>
        <p class="profile-copy">Eric Holt-Gim_nez has been Executive Director of Food First since 2006. He is the editor of the Food First bookFood Movements Unite! Strategies to Transform Our Food Systems; co-author of Food Rebellions! Crisis and the Hunger for Justice with
          Raj Patel and Annie Shattuck; and author of the book Campesino a Campesino: Voices from Latin AmericaÍs Farmer to Farmer Movement for Sustainable Agriculture and of many academic, magazine and news articles. Of Basque and Puerto Rican heritage,
          Eric grew up milking cows and pitching hay in Point Reyes, CA, where he learned that putting food on the table is hard work. After studying rural education and biology at the University of Oregon and Evergreen State College, he traveled through
          Mexico and Central America, where he was drawn to the simple life of small-scale farmers. When he arrived to work in the community of Vicente Guerrero in the impoverished state of Tlaxcala, Mexico in 1977, the place was surrounded by eroded
          and deforested hills and farmers were not able to grow enough food to feed their families. But the village did have a small elementary school and an energetic young mayor and Eric enthusiastically joined his efforts to revitalize the community.
          They started a school garden, a water project, a health clinic and a sewing coop. Several Mayan farmers from Guatemala visited at just the right time to lead a field course on soil and water conservation that helped restore the degraded environment
          and boost farmerÍs yields. From that experience, the Campesino a Campesino (farmer to farmer) movement was born. In the four decades since, this peasant-led sustainable agriculture movement has spread steadily across Latin Americacreating innovative
          farming methods, raising yields and improving livelihoods for hundreds of thousands of small farmers and their families. After spending over twenty-five years with the resourceful farmers of Central America and Mexico, Eric holds a deep appreciation
          for the value and power of building local food systems. But he has also become painfully aware that working locally is never going to be enough to bring about the larger changes that are needed: ñSmall farmers and underserved urban communities
          need changes in national food policies and international trade rules to have a fighting chance of feeding themselves and building healthy, prosperous livelihoods.î Eric has a MSc. in International Agricultural Development from University of
          California at Davis and a PhD in Environmental Studies from the University of California at Santa Cruz . He has taught Development Studies at UC Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz, Boston University and the National Gastronomic University in Pollenzo,
          Italy. Prior to working at Food First, he served as the Latin America Program Manager for the Bank Information Center (BIC) in Washington DC. In EricÍs words, ñsuccessful social movements are formed by integrating activism with livelihoods.
          These integrated movements create the sustained social pressure that produces political willthe key to changing the financial, governmental and market structures that presently work against sustainability.î</p>

        <p class="profile-copy">Emily Levine was a successful television writer/producer (Designing Women, Love and War, Dangerous Minds) as well as a stand-up comedian on TV (ñLate Nite with David Lettermanî) and at major clubs around the country, but found neither career fulfilling.
          Since then, sheÍs become the Jon Stewart of science, finding comic gold at the interface of science and society. Her appearances at conferences (including four appearances at TED where she was recently voted one of the 100 all-time favorite
          speakers); in corporate venues; and onstage (in NY, LA and San Francisco) have received accolades from the press (ñOne of the new Queens of Comedyî, NEWSWEEK), from the scientific community (ñEmily @ the Edge of Chaosî is a brilliant mix of

        <h2 class="profile-name">Alison Meyer</h2>
        <p class="profile-byline">Leadership Coach</p>
        <p class="profile-copy">Alison teaches leadership communications at UC BerkeleyÍs Haas School of Business and around the world. She also consults to individuals and corporations as an executive coach, facilitator, and leadership program developer. A proud UC Berkeley
          ñdouble bearî (MBA 2011, BA Art History 1987) she helps people find their stories and voice, move through giant obstacles, be curious about the people around them, listen fiercely, open their hearts, and aspire outrageously. Her company is www.UnconditionalLeadership.com.
          During her 20s she worked various administrative roles in art, design and consulting companies, and started to train and perform in theater at night. Building skill in accounting led to consultancy with clients in design, tech and manufacturing.
          The business afforded flexibility for her passion, theater, while she built a practice as a trusted advisor to entrepreneurial, innovative clients. The next 10 years were business consultant by day, singer-actress by night, and not much sleep.
          In 2005, after much soul-searching, she closed the consulting business and put aside singing to find focus on a single career combining left brain and right brain, arts, technology and business. This intention led her to AppleÍs iTunes, where
          she helped build the digital content business in TV and Movies. During the Apple years, life stabilized, she watched a lot of TV, and immersed herself in tech. She returned to Berkeley for the #1-ranked Haas Evening Weekend MBA, and was promoted
          to Manager at Apple. At Haas Alison discovered that the experience sheÍd left behind in the acting studio and on stage could be used in the real world to help people develop their presence and find their voice. In 2009 she began teaching leadership
          communications at Haas, and consulting to companies and private clients. In 2013 she transitioned into coaching and consulting full time. The coaching process and mindset has taught her life-changing skills around slowing down, really listening,
          stepping into difficulty bravely, and making others look good, skills that she already had from theater. Her mission is to pass these tools on, and teach others how to pass them on. Her current favorite word is ñyet.î</p>

        <p class="profile-copy">Skilled in skilling. Abling the disabled. It is inspirational to help the poor. Or the disabled. Or the young in remote villages of rural India. Meera Shenoy has transformed lives in all three categories. She has pioneered a training model that
          skills underprivileged youth for jobs in todayÍs market. She has achieved this, while in leadership positions in the government, the private sector, and presently, in a social enterprise. Meera Shenoy is the Founder-Chairperson of Youth4Jobs
          (www.youth4jobs.org), which focuses on helping companies build an inclusive workforce. In just three years, Y4J has become one of the largest organisations in India in the field. It has reached out to over 100,000 rural households, trained 4500
          disabled youth, and placed 70% in jobs, and 40% of these are girls with disabilities. Meera was awarded the NCPEDP-Shell Helen Keller award in 2012. Her disability work was featured online in the Harvard Business Review and the Stanford Social
          Innovation Review. In 2004, Meera was asked to join the Andhra Pradesh government to initiate and lead IndiaÍs first Jobs Mission for rural and tribal youth. She changed the focus of the governmentÍs work from ïtraining for trainingÍs sakeÍ,
          to market-speaker_image_uried training programs for youth, including the last mile of placing them in jobs. Meera Shenoy has uniquely shown, that large-scale job training and placement can be done, and in a short period. When she left in 2010,
          the Jobs Mission had become one of the largest jobs mission for the poor, with 150,000 rural and tribal youth placed in jobs, over 5 years. Scale in hirings came from training innovations tailored to market needs, such as creating IndiaÍs first
          grass-roots program in English, work readiness and computer skills. A unique IT architecture speaker_image_uried to e-payment ensured transparency. The Jobs Mission work won several awards including the South Asia Manthan award for e-inclusion.
