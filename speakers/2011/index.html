        <h2 class="profile-name">Bryan Alvarez</h2>
        <p class="profile-byline">Bryan Alvarez is a doctor...</p>
        <p class="profile-copy">Bryan Alvarez is a doctoral candidate at the University of California, Berkeley, researching brain-based and cognitive mechanisms of a unique form of sensory-blending called synesthesia, which he also experiences. Bryan made a transition from
          music performance to life sciences during his undergraduate education at Oberlin College and Conservatory of Music after rediscovering a passion for the delicate and vast intricacy of living systems, and in particular the human brain. He earned
          degrees in Trombone Performance (BM) and Biology (BA, emphasis in Neuroscience) and later accepted an invitation to study at UC Berkeley, beginning his doctoral research on synesthesia in 2006.<br/><br/>Accessible education and mentorship have
          always been dear to heart for Bryan. He co-founded and helps lead a K-12 outreach program called Mind and Brain Outreach, which brings graduate students into schools to teach about their love of the mind and brain, often to several hundred students
          at a time in interactive exhibit-based events called Mind and Brain Nights. He has also given many talks for scientific and public audiences (grade school to adult) on the beauty and intrigue of the mind and brain, and on his own research.<br/><br/>In
          September of 2009, Bryan began organizing a project to create the first fully 3D interactive, online, open-contribution, and scalable atlas of the human body as a mission to celebrate the beauty of living things, beginning with the vast and
          stunning human body, and share that celebration with the world.</p>

        <p class="profile-copy">Jason R. Atwood is a Ph.D. student in the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, Berkeley and the director of Ethiopia ConnectED, an education initiative inspired by TEDster Sugata MitraÍs research on self-organized learning
          environments. Modeled on Dr. MitraÍs ñHole-in-the-Wallî project, the mission of Ethiopia ConnectED is to facilitate autonomous and child-mediated learning in resource-insecure areas of the Global South by building a network of solar-powered
          computer learning centers that utilize free and open source software.<br/><br/>JasonÍs doctoral research is concerned with the psychology of learning and the sociological factors that influence student motivation and achievement: What dynamics
          promote and inhibit the belief that intellectual growth is possible? How does the language commonly associated with the institution of school influence whether people feel responsible for their academic trajectory? What components of classroom
          design and school architecture affect the desire to seek novel challenges and positively respond to setbacks and failures?<br/><br/>Perhaps the most important question, however, is that which was posed to him by a professor of international
          development: ñWhat will you do with the knowledge you learned today that will change the world tomorrow?î JasonÍs interest in educational technology is animated by the challenge to meaningfully respond to this call for action.</p>

        <p class="profile-byline">Anat Baniel is the founde...</p>
        <p class="profile-copy">Anat Baniel is the founder of the Anat Baniel Method(sm) and the director of the ABM Center in Marin County, California, where she and her colleagues teach professional training programs, workshops and see private clients. AnatÍs background is
          in clinical psychology, dance and statistics. She studied and later worked closely with Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais with whom she began her path to better understand how the brain can change itself and how to apply brain plasticity principles _ a
          distinction that did not exist at the time _ to improve peopleÍs lives.<br/><br/>Anat is the author of the bestselling book, Move Into Life, The Nine Essentials for Lifelong Vitality, where she describes breakthrough, yet simple ways, to access
          the remarkable powers of our brains to create new patterns that transform our lives for the better. She has worked with a wide range of students from professional musicians such as the San Francisco Symphony and the Tanglewood Music Center to
          dancers, athletes and regular folk, helping them overcome debilitating pain, RSI symptoms, injury and most importantly, helping them reach new levels of performance and well being both physically and mentally. She is currently writing a book
          about her work with special needs children for Penguin Group. She is also a contributor to the Huffington Post.<br/><br/>Anat is internationally known for her work with children with special needs from a few days old to teenagers. Her understanding
          of how to use movement and touch, combined with attention and other mental processes, offers a scientifically-based breakthrough method for helping these children. The changes in these children (and in adults) often reach beyond what is considered
          possible.<br/><br/>Her theory is being validated more and more by recent brain research and her work has been endorsed by medical doctors and leading brain scientists. Dr Michael Merzenich, famed neuroscientist and member of the National academy
          of sciences, describes the work Anat has developed as, ñpowerful, practical strategies for improving your abilities and your brain that are strongly supported by the neuroscience of brain plasticity.î Anat envisions profound transformations
          in the areas of fitness, rehabilitation, anti-aging, vitality, and therapy for special needs children once the focus will shift from ñthe bodyî to the brain. As brain plasticity principles and applications are more widely understood and implemented
          in these areas, it will lead to surprisingly better and quicker outcomes with significantly less suffering in the process.</p>

        <p class="profile-copy">David Silverman is an animator best known for directing numerous episodes of the animated TV series The Simpsons, as well as The Simpsons Movie. Silverman was involved with the series from the very beginning, where he animated all of the original
          Simpsons Tracy Ullman shorts and went on to serve as director of animation for several years.<br/><br/>SilvermanÍs direction and animation is known for its energy, sharp timing, adventurous use of design elements and often complex acting, involving
          expressions and poses which are often quixotic, emotionally specific or highly exaggerated. It frequently recalls the works of Ward Kimball, Tex Avery, Bob Clampett and Chuck Jones. His most prolific period of work on The Simpsons can be roughly
          categorized as beginning with the ñTracy Ullmanî episodes and ending in or around season eight of the series, for which he animated HomerÍs psychedelic dream in ñEl Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)î. Other representative
          examples of SilvermanÍs work on ñThe Simpsonsî include the HomerÍs histrionic, spasmodic heart attack in ñHomerÍs Triple Bypassî, HomerÍs demented hysterics over the iconic painting of poker-playing canines in ñTreehouse of Horror IVî and subsequent
          turn as an even-more-deranged appropriation of Jack NicholsonÍs character from ñThe Shiningî in ñTreehouse of Horror Vî, and HomerÍs archetypically cartoonish reaction to BartÍs prescription of Focusyn in ñBrotherÍs Little Helperî.<br/><br/>Silverman
          is also the director of the The Simpsons Movie, which was released July 27, 2007. He originally left The Simpsons to direct additional sequences in The Road to El Dorado for DreamWorks. Some of his other film work includes Monsters, Inc. for
          Disney and Pixar, in which he was a co-director. He is currently a consulting producer and occasional director.<br/><br/>Silverman plays the tuba and has performed at events like Burning Man and on June 23, 2006, he appeared on The Tonight Show
          with Jay Leno, where he played his flaming sousaphone. Silverman was a member of the UCLA Bruin Marching Band Sousaphone Section in the early 1980s. He is currently a member of Los Trancos Woods Community Marching Band. In January 2009, Silverman
          joined the LA band Vaud and the Villains.</p>

        <p class="profile-copy">Composer, multi-instrumentalist, and TED veteran Matt Venuti opened the 2004 conference in Monterey with a solo from a unique and fascinating device that no one had previously heard of, the Electronic Valve Instrument, or EVI . He went on to play
          the EVI as lead instrumentalist in Thomas DolbyÍs TED house band throughout the conference. At TEDx heÍll offer another unique musical expression playing something that has created a renaissance in music instrument designthe first ñviral instrumentî
          and arguably the most beautiful and captivating ever, the Pan Art Hang. The name Hang comes from the Swiss German word for hand. A handmade ñsound sculptureî with an innovative design, the PanArt Hang is hand-crafted by only two people in the
          world, Swiss artists Felix Rohner and Sabina Sh_rer in Bern. Over time the Hang makers and certain players began to realize that the Hang was no typical musical instrument, as reports came back to them many times over of properties in the Hang
          that had strong and positive effects on the body/mind/spirit of both player and listener. Matt Venuti was one of the first to recognize this phenomenon and set out to explore the effects of the Hang as an instrument of quieting the mind and
          opening the heart. He performs regular ñHang Immersionî concerts and works with individuals and groups to help awaken inner wisdom, joy, and a sense of wholeness through the resonating sounds of the Hang.</p>
